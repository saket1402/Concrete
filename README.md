Removing Inconsistencies in Concrete Compressive Strength using Machine Learning Algorithms

Consider business scenario where a Construction firm has to withhold the procurement of testing equipments which provided the quality test results 
concrete strength attribute. In such scenario Machine learning can help with estimating the concrete strength using the previous records.

This project makes use of several Machine learinng algorithms to predict concrete strenght using avaialble attributes.

Concrete compressive strength Concrete compressive strength which ismeasured in MegaPascal (MPa). This isthe unit for pressure or stress and is the
common unit to determine compressive
strength of concrete.
